# My-Story
A platform capable of automatically summarizing the content of images uploaded by users, generating a title and a meaningful description of the content using Artificial Intelligence (AI).
## Context
The field of visual content management is rapidly expanding, with growing demand for tools that enable more effective understanding and utilization of images. Today, users generate and share a massive amount of images, whether for professional or personal purposes. However, extracting useful information from these images, such as their content, meaning, or context, remains a complex challenge.
This project aims to study the feasibility of a platform capable of automatically summarizing the content of images uploaded by users. By using advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and language models, this solution will automatically generate a title and a brief description for each image. This feasibility study will assess the potential benefits of such a tool, as well as the technical challenges and risks associated with its development.
## Objective
Our goal is to create easy-to-use APIs that enhance the image posting experience for users on social media platforms. These APIs aim to generate meaningful text, providing a description of the content using Artificial Intelligence (AI). This solution is particularly designed to meet the needs of young people who regularly post stories and visual content on social media.
## Technologies to Use
* LLM (Chat GPT API)
* ML (Image captioning)
* Web Development (Microservices architecture)
